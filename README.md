# ðŸ’µ Borrow millions for free from Aave using Flash Loans

Let's build an example where you can experience how we can start a flash loan. Note we won't be actually doing an arbitrage here, because finding profitable arbitrage opportunities is the hardest part and not related to the code, but will essentially just learn how to execute a flash loan.

```
NOTE: Just like hedge funds protect their trading strategies, protecting arbitrage opportunities is important for arbitrageurs.
If those opportunities are made public, they really aren't opportunities anymore as someone is always willing to 'do it cheaper'
driving the profit margin to essentially zero.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
